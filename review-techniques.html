    <h2>Formal Review Techniques</h2>
    <p>In this section, you'll learn about various review techniques such as walkthroughs and inspections. These techniques help ensure that work products meet the required quality standards.</p>

    <h3>Interactive Demonstration: Walkthrough vs. Inspection</h3>
    <p>Let's explore how different review techniques can uncover defects in a sample document. Select a technique to see it in action:</p>

    <div style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
        <button onclick="showTechnique('walkthrough')">Walkthrough</button>
        <button onclick="showTechnique('inspection')">Inspection</button>
    </div>

    <div id="technique-details" style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; background-color: #f9f9f9;">
        <p>Select a technique to see how it works.</p>
    </div>

        const techniqueDetails = document.getElementById('technique-details');
        const feedback = document.getElementById('feedback');

        if (technique === 'walkthrough') {
            techniqueDetails.innerHTML = `
                    <h4>Walkthrough</h4>
                    <p>In a walkthrough, the author of the work product guides the participants through the document, explaining the content and reasoning behind decisions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> During the walkthrough of a requirement document, the author explains a complex algorithm. A participant raises a concern that the algorithm might not scale well for large datasets, leading to a performance issue. This concern is noted for further analysis.</p>
                    <p>Outcome: The walkthrough helps identify potential performance issues early in the process, allowing the team to address them before implementation.</p>
                `;
            feedback.textContent = 'Walkthroughs are excellent for sharing knowledge and catching issues that might be overlooked in individual reviews.';
        } else if (technique === 'inspection') {
            techniqueDetails.innerHTML = `
                    <h4>Inspection</h4>
                    <p>An inspection is a more formal and structured review technique. Each participant reviews the document individually before the meeting, and during the meeting, they discuss specific issues identified.</p>
                    <p><strong>Scenario:</strong> During the inspection of a design document, a reviewer notices that a critical security check is missing. This issue is raised and discussed among the team, leading to the addition of the necessary security measures in the design.</p>
                    <p>Outcome: The inspection uncovers significant defects, such as missing security checks, which could have led to serious vulnerabilities if not caught early.</p>
                `;
            feedback.textContent = 'Inspections are highly effective at identifying critical defects, especially those related to security and compliance.';

            feedback.textContent = '';
